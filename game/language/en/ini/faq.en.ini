;Allgemeine Fragen
IDEA_GAME_TEXT = "With Mammun, we want to show you, that everything is related:
	You are helping your Mammuns to discover islands.\n
	Your warriors depend on the inventions of your thinkers to get better, and
	the latter in turn depend on the warriors discovering more land to grow 
	more food.\n
	You see, everything is interconnected - and [b]you[/b] decide what to do...
	As complicated as that might sound, there is no need to worry: You are 
	playing together with your friends and we too help you out.
	And in any case, there are the FAQ..."

	need any data.\n
	However, if for example you tell us where you are from, we can suggest

	By the way, your email address is only used to verify that you are a

HOW_EARNS_GAUSUS_MONEY_TEXT = "Playing Mammun is for free, no hidden fees and 
	no subscriptions. Promised. If you want to personalize your Mammuns or your

HOW_OFTEN_PLAY_TEXT = "No, of course not! Mammun is a [LINK REALTIME_SOCIAL_GAME_WHAT]Social Realtime Game [/LINK]
	and that means [b]you[/b] decide when you want play. Log-in, tell your
	thinkers what to invent or send out your warriors and then maybe just
	visist your friends. \n
	Let your Mammuns do what you told them and come back later to for example
	train some Mammuns or to make another invention. Or have a look at your
	friends' treasure chest...\n 
	There is always something to do, but you can do it [b]your[/b]way and
	whenever [b]you[/b]want. Your Mammuns would never dare to steal your time."

HOW_TO_PLAY_TEXT = "It's easy: sign-up with your email address and tell us who
	you are.\n
	You will receive an email containing a confirmation link. Just click on it

GAUSUS_WHO_TEXT = "We are a team of designers, coders and others and develop

	We want to bring back the ''social'' into gaming."
ADVERTISING_TEXT = "No. We are convinced that playing without advertising is so
	much more fun. That is why we kept all of Mammun free from advertising.\n
	At Mammun, there are no spam-mails either."
;STARTPAGE ONLY
SOCIAL_GAME_WHAT_TEXT = "A social game is a game that is played together, as
	opposed to a game that is played with strangers.\n
	Mammun is a social game, just like soccer or chess for example - just a 
	little better...."
;STARTPAGE ONLY
REALTIMEGAME_WHAT_TEXT = "Games in general can be divided into realtime games
	and turnbased games.\n
	A turnbased game allows the player a set number of actions per turn. In 
	chess for example, one peg can be moved per turn.\n
	Each move is carried out immediately, a turn has no ''duration'' as such: 
	the pawn captures the king.\n
	In a realtime game however, each move has - like in reality - a duration,
	that means that - in the above example - the king could still flee while
	the pawn was approaching." 
;STARTPAGE ONLY
SOCIAL_REALTIME_GAME_WHAT_TEXT = "Mammun is a Social Realtime Game, combining
	the advantages of a social game (playing with friends) and those of a
	realtime game (playing without waiting one's turn).\n
	Since Mammun is actually an asynchronous realtime game, you can play 
	directly with your friends no matter if you are online the same time
	or not."
;STARTPAGE ONLY
MAMMUN_VIOLENT_TEXT = "No. Mammun is about the mutual dependency of exploration
	and inventions. Violence can not solve this problem of distributing limited
	resources between equally important goals.\n
	Hence, Mammun is about making smart use of warriors and thinkers to be the
	first to entirely discover an island.\n
	Disputes about glades between players are indicated by a symbol and the 
	game mechanics assure that smart choices prevail over malicious intent." 

;The Game, Getting started
START_SITUATION_TEXT = "You are on an island, directly together with your
	friends. The island is totally undiscovered but of your respective 
	home glades.\n
	Each of you has 5 thinkers and 2 warriors at their disposal and the one
	first discovering the entire island wins.\n
	Make smart choices on what to invent and where to go, making the best use
	of your scarce resources and being faster than your friends."
GOAL_OF_GAME_TEXT = "At Mammun, you win if you are the to discover the entire
	island.\n
	Make smart use of your thinkers and warriors to gain the edge needed to
	be faster than your friends.\n
	With respect to your friends: don't forget, they too want to win the 
	island, so find out how to be faster than them: more thinkers? Different
	inventions? More warriors? It is up to you, let's go!"
DIFFERENCES_BETWEEN_ISLANDS_TEXT = "We have three different sizes of islands on
	offer to allow for a fair play: islands for four, six and eight players.
	By the way, there are no two identical islands, even if the share the
	shape, lakes and mountains get arranged differently for each island."
;INGAME ONLY
IMPORTANCE_ISLAND_SELECTION_TEXT = "The most important question is if you want
	to play with new people or with your friends.\n
	Playing with your friends you can either meet them on their island or you
	can even open-up your own one...\n
	If you are not sure about your new island, just use the travel box and
	have a look what it looks like."
;INGAME ONLY
HOW_TO_SCORE_TEXT = "Your XP shows how how well you are doing, so everything 
	that makes you better increases your XP.\n
	The more buildings you construct, the more inventions you make and the more
	Mammuns and glades you have, the more XP you get."
ANSWER_NOT_FOUND_TEXT = "We are working hard to maintain these FAQ most up-to-date.
	If you feel that we didn't answer your question, just send us an email to 
	support@mammun.com and we take care of it. \n
	Thanks a lot."

;Who is who and what are they good for?
;INGAME ONLY
DEFINITION_BERNARD_TEXT="Bernard is your assistant, he has information on almost 
	everything on the island and at times he even suggests what to invent.\n
	Why Bernard is named Bernard? Well, that is a well-kept secret..."
MAXIMAL_NUMBER_PEOPLE_TEXT="You can have as many Mammuns as you want, that is,
	as long as you can provide them with the necessary room. Each Mammun 
	requires at least a tent to live in.\n
	How many thinkers or warriors you can train, depends on the amount of food
	you are able to collect and produce on your part of the island.\n
	So try to balance your food production with your need for Mammuns."
DIFFERENCE_EXPLORER_THINKER_TEXT = "Your Mammuns can be trained to either be
	warriors or thinkers.
	Like the name suggests, warriors explore new glades and thus increase 
	your part of the island and thus the amount of resources available to you.
	thinkers on the other hand, invent what you tell them, thus making for 
	better warriores and improved resource production."
;ONCE_THINKER_ALWAYS_THINKER_TEXT = "Natürlich kannst du Denker - wie im richtigen 
;	Leben auch - jederzeit zu Entdeckern ausbilden. Dazu musst du die Denker

;ONCE_EXPLORER_ALWAYS_EXPLORER_TEXT = "Natürlich müssen Entdecker nicht immer Entdecker
;	bleiben! Wenn du denkst, ein paar mehr Denker wären ein guter Gedanke, dann
;	kannst du Entdecker aus ihrem Dienst entlassen und sie zu Denkern 
;	ausbilden."
DEFINITION_FIGHT_TEXT = "Fights are the result of two or more of a map's 
	players claiming the same glade." 
WHEN_FIGHT_TEXT = "Sending your warrior to a glade already dominated by one 
	of your co-players or by the dark will result in a fight."
VARIABLES_RESULT_FIGHT_TEXT = "The result of a fight depends on how many 
	Mammuns are engaged and how strong they are.
	If a lot of your Mammuns oppose a small number of others, a quick win is 
	likely. However, if the few Mammuns are exceptionally well trained they 
	might withstand and even win. 
	You see, a fight is something highly complex and a winner cannot be 
	established in adavance (which gives you the opportunity to engage more
	Mammuns, should your chances fade)."
WHAT_IF_HOSTILE_WINS_TEXT = "If your Mammuns loose a fight, they abandon the
	island and cannot be used as warriors or thinkers anymore.\n
	As for your consolation, all their cloths and treasures will be put in 
	your treasure chest and can be used again."
DEFINITION_SECTOR_TEXT = "A glade is a small part of your island. \n
	To improve the usability of Mammun, we devided the islands into small 
	parts, called glades. You can send your warriors to glades and you can
	build buildings within your glades."

	''Cooking'' or things like the wheel."
WHY_INVENT_TEXT = "Inventions form the very basis of our life - without them we
	had no cozy houses and not even food. It's the same for your Mammuns:
	inventions like the tent or farming provide for better housing and more to
	eat.\n
	And as if that wasn't reason enough to invent, some inventions like the bow
	and arrow improve your warriors' standing against unpleasant neighbors."

	think about, and they will make the invention.\n

DEFINITION_EXPLORER_TEXT = "Your warriors explore new glades for you thus 
	increasing your stock in wood and food.

WHAT_IF_SECTOR_OCCUPIED_TEXT="There are two possible outcomes:
