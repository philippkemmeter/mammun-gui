STONES_DESC = "A really important issue!\n
	Stones are hard things that are easy to find. Knocking a stone against

BIRCH_PITCH_DESC = "After using birch-logs for our ususal hearth fires 
	we sometimes find strange black dollops in the fireplace. \n
	Interestingly enough, they seem to be [b]water restistant[/b] - quite a good

	this water resistant stuff in greater quantities?"
CONTAINERS_DESC = "The more food we gahter, the more difficult it gets to store
	it. It's lying around everywhere and rot really fast.\n

JOINT_DESC = "While chewing on those plants I saw a whole lot of funny

	leads."
KNOT_DESC = "Our thinkers tried hard to create a [b]tent[/b] out of an animal

	[b]We should think about this![/b]"
NETS_DESC = "We saw, that spiders catch their prey using their webs. 
	Looking at their webs we recognized that they are made up of an orderly

	a kind of web - with wich we could catch fish for example..." 
SLING_DESC = "Our knots have a problem, they always close and don't stay put. If we

AGRICULTURE_DESC = "Hey, guess what? The other day we found plants at exactly
	the same places where we accidentally dropped some seeds last year. \n
	Imagine how much time we'd have left for things other than gathering,

	Let's call the thinkers!"
SKINNING_DESC = "The skins of animals are water resistent and also seem to block

WEAPON_REVOLUTION_DESC = "Woulnd't it be revolutionary to combine most of our

COOK_MEAT_DESC = "The meat goes bad really fast, let's ask the thinkers to

CORNUS_DESC = "Lately we found out that of all the shrubs we know
	one is quite particular, the Cornus.

	Let's ask the thinkers and see with what they come up."
BOWSTRING_DESC = "The thinkers want to use a sling in order to fix some
	sort of string to a piece of wood...\n
	They need the string to be strong enough, so they want to improve on 
	the fibres we already know.
	I don't exactly understand what that should be good for but then they
	are our thinkers, so they might as well try, don't you think?"
BOW_PURE_DESC = "Tststs, those thinkers... Now that they have their bowstring
	they want to find a way to bow the wood somehow, as to straighten the

	one that could be a tool as well as a weapon...\n
	Do you want to give them a try?"
ARROWS_DESC = "Wow, appranty that Bow is quite ingenious. Everyone wants to

	angry animals (or neighbors)."
BONES_DESC = "Those animals we hunt taste really well. Only after the meals,
	some really hard materials is left over - we call it bones. \n

	It's such a petty throwing it all away, so I suggest that we ask our

CHOP_DOWN_TREES2_DESC = "Felling trees is quite labourous. Let's find a

	We could for example improve our technique of moving the axe and we

BLADE_DESC = "A Blade would be definitely the most important invention
	to date - and the sharpest as well... \n
	By manipulating the edges of flintstones, they become sharper and allow
	an improved cutting.\n
	We should invent this cutting-edge technology, don't you think?"
DRILL_DESC = "Wouldn't it be great if we were able to drill holes into

	Let's find out, how to build a drill!"
ADZE_BEATEN_DESC = "If we fixed a flintstone to a stick, we could
	apply more force. That could help us hollowing-out trunks for example.\n
	\n
	Our thinkers already came up with a name for the to be-invented tool:
	they would call it Adze... What do you think, should they actually 
	invent it, now that they have a name for it?"
ADZE_SHARPENED_DESC = "That Adze is quite an amazing tool, it is now much

AXE_BEATEN_DESC = "That Adze we invented was a major improvement for working
	with already-cut timber.\n

AXE_BEATEN_SHARPENED_DESC = "Wow, those Axes are great! Somehow, however, the

	and sharpened Axe by sharpening it still further..."
DIGWOOD_DESC = "Growing plants seems to be much easier if the seeds are

WHEEL_DESC = "How could that happen? We still did not invent the wheel! 
	Let's do so now..."
WALZENBEIL_DESC = "Some of our warriors mentioned that the Digwood wasn't
	enough on hard soils - they ask for a different tool by the strange

	Our thinkers propose a kind of Digwood with a stone attached to it -
	what do you think of this idea?"
JAVELIN_DESC = "There are some pretty dangerous animals out there in the
	woods - and some very unfriendly neighbours as well...\n
	\n

ADV_JAVELIN_SHARPENED_DESC = "The warriors like the stone-tipped Javelin
	quite a lot, but now they ask for improved targeting. One thinker

	\n
	Should we look into it?"
HARPOON_DESC = "Wenn wir versuchen Tiere oder Fische mit dem Wurfspieß zu 
	fangen, dann verlieren wir immer den Spieß. Wir könnten versuchen, ein Seil

ADV_BOW_DESC = "Some of our more innovative warriors use the Javelin to 
	catch fish and hunt animals - with quite impressive results I have to

CAMOUFLAGE_DESC = "Camouflage seems to bring about the fact that one can
